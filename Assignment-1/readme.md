# Assignment 1

## Exercise A

### Which of the following two questions do you expect will be easiest to answer?
- A: What are the three most important problems using Scrum
- B: What are the three important problems with using Scrum
* 
    ```
    We expect that the answer B is the easiest to answer because you dont have to compare problems to determine which problems are bigger. You just have to find important problems and report them.
    ```

One problem with scrum can be that the Product Owner doesn't understand what exactly his business needs, so he will make bad decisions. Maybe he will also not understand how important his role is so he doesn't show up to meetings etc.

In this blog post about the PO problem we think that it is a valid claim, but some of the claims are a little bit stechted out. Like if you decide to use scrum you will tell the PO about meetings and other stuff and if you have a serious business you will attend the meetings you are supposed to and not just stay away.

    Does have link to organization in description, but they are not updated and some links don't work.
