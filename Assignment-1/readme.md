### A list of the 3 most biggest stumbling blocks

1. The first stumbling block was the lack of knowledge about finding hidden messages in pictures and Steganography.

2. The second stumbling block was the amount of research we had to do to get a understanding of the Steganography and then use that knowledge in the exercise.

3. The third stumbling block was finding a way to code and solve the exercise.
We had a hard time finding the hidden message. We had to look up a lot of guides on how to approch this exercise. But in the end we didn't manage to find the hidden message.

### Diary

```
10:30 start

    What: Reaseaching the internet for information on Steganography.
    Problem: The lack of knowlege of Steganography.
    Done in: 90 mins
12:00 Getting ready to code a solution.
12:15
    what: Codeing the decoding part.
    Problem: Had problems with converting the least significant bit to a message.
    Done in: 2 hours
14:15 Couldnt find a way to solve the decoding part, so we stopped codeing and started on the hand-in.

## Exercise A

### Which of the following two questions do you expect will be easiest to answer?
- A: What are the three most important problems using Scrum
- B: What are the three important problems with using Scrum
* 
    ```
    We expect that the answer B is the easiest to answer because you dont have to compare problems to determine which problems are bigger. You just have to find important problems and report them.
    ```

One problem with scrum can be that the Product Owner doesn't understand what exactly his business needs, so he will make bad decisions. Maybe he will also not understand how important his role is so he doesn't show up to meetings etc.

In this blog post about the PO problem we think that it is a valid claim, but some of the claims are a little bit stechted out. Like if you decide to use scrum you will tell the PO about meetings and other stuff and if you have a serious business you will attend the meetings you are supposed to and not just stay away.

## Exercise C

### Assessing a Youtube video

* 
    ```
    No intro with Author, organization or anything, video just starts right away. (On Youtube you can see the Author below the video)
    Does have link to organization in description, but they are not updated and some links don't work.
    Video comments do contain comments like "nice" with no contribution or anything else so it just presents itself kinda like spam.
    No links to any documentation, reputable person, sources etc.
